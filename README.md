## Data Set Information:
This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

  # Attribute Information:
  - date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
  - time: time in format hh:mm:ss
  - globalactivepower: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
  - globalreactivepower: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
  - voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
  - global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
  - submetering1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not   
    electric but gas powered).
  - submetering2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
  - submetering3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
